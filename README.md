Alys Nan Longland Estate Database
=================================

The files herein describe the implementation of the estate management database
used for the mananagement of a deceased estate.  It is provided here for the
sake of documentation purposes, and comes with no warranty or support
whatsoever.

The system is built on Django, and in production, ran on a PostgreSQL
back-end atop a Gentoo server and was active from about mid-2015 through to
April 2020, hosted on infrastructure that I own and maintain.

I do not recommend its use for future purposes, however parts of its code base
may be used by third parties in any manner they see fit subject to the license
conditions of the various dependencies used.
